Letterz is just a fun little game I wanted to create while testing out Node.js modules. The idea behind it is quite simple.

1. You must give Letterz a string of characters
1. Letterz will search the list of words for words that can be spelled with those characters
1. Letterz will return the list of words it found to you
1. Letterz will calculate a score based on the 'specialness' of your given letters and the result it produced
1. Done! Neat huh?

Perhaps this is a future game with some kind of GUI in the making?
